AWS Cloud Security Monitoring and Alerting Platform
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a foundational Cloud Security Monitoring and Alerting Platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The goal is to gain hands-on experience with core AWS services to collect, analyze, and respond to security-related events within a cloud environment.

Problem Solved
This platform addresses the need for:

Centralized Log Collection: Gathering security logs from various AWS services.

Automated Threat Detection: Identifying suspicious activities and misconfigurations.

Real-time Alerting: Notifying stakeholders of critical security events.

Basic Automated Remediation: Demonstrating automated responses to incidents.

Visibility: Providing a way to query and visualize security data.

Key Technologies Used
AWS Services: IAM, S3, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, CloudWatch Logs, Lambda, Glue, Athena, GuardDuty, Security Hub, SNS, Systems Manager, QuickSight.

Programming Languages: Python (boto3).

Version Control: Git/GitHub.

Query Language: SQL (Athena).

Setup and Usage
Detailed setup instructions will be provided in separate documentation. In brief, this involves configuring AWS services, deploying Python functions, and setting up data pipelines and alerts.
